# Design-and-Simulation-of-DC-DC-Boost-Converter
Designed a boost converter to regulate output voltage at 48 V from a variable input (20–28 V) and variable load current (8–16 A).

Achieved voltage ripple ≤ 4% at a switching frequency of 100 kHz.

Modeled, simulated, and analyzed the converter using MATLAB/Simulink to verify performance under different operating conditions.
